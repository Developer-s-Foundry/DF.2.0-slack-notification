## System Design

### How It Works

1. **Client** sends a request to create, update, or change a task.
2. **Cache** stores temporary data for fast retrieval.
3. **Scheduler** manages timing and background processing of notifications.
4. **Database** persists all task information (task id, task name, assigned\_to, due\_at, created\_at, updated\_at).
5. **Redis Queue** holds notification jobs before they are sent.
6. **Slack Server** receives the final payload and delivers the message to the Slack channel.

REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xxxxx
PORT=8080
```
